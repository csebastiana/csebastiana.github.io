1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

My system is based on many other websites that sell anime inspired merchandise. Primarily the original idea was to sell stickers, but since we were required to add other items I went with things that most other sites sell as well. My inspiration was chottominute.com

2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

I think my main feature that isn't implemented is the ability to constantly see what is in the cart. I believe that will dock off a majority of points from my code. I'm sure everything else works fine.

3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:

I am most proud of how I adapted code from others to fit my own need. I believe that the ability to take code (and credit of course) from others and tailor them to your own needs is important when coding because the internet is at your disposal. You just gotta use it right!

4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:

I am the least happy with how it looks. I feel like I may have been able to make it look a lot better but I am genuinely okay with how it appears. Another gripe I have is that I had to copy so much code. I am disappointed in myself because of this, but I'm glad that I was able to make my site work and not look like a complete mirror image of Alyssa's code.

5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?

Developing this assignment was different than assignment 2 in the fact that there were a ton of harder requirements. These included cookies, sessions and I think each addition was harder than the next.

6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?

Test. Test, test, test! I think I spent over 10 hours testing my code on the live server. This is my fault because I don't know how to test it on my own machine, but I'm glad I was able to test it on the main server after others were done testing their own work. 

7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?

I think what worked well in doing this assignment was the ability to just pass over code from the last one. If we were required to code this from the ground up I belive it would have been a very, very difficult task.

8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?

I honestly can't say. I missed a lot of class (no excuse) so I can't blame anything on anyone. I guess what didn't work well was not going to class! I learned everything through trial and error, looking at classmates code and also watching the class recordings.

9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?

I'd like to say that I learned how painful it is to procrastinate but I've learned that a majority of times. I just know that this time it was the hardest. Usually I procrastinate and am able to finish things before the deadline but this was different.

10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?

I would attend every single class. Because I didn't, it made the task way harder than it should have been and also eliminated my chances of asking for help. I don't like to ask outside of class time because I don't like to be a nuisance. 

11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

I don't really think things out so I didn't think much. I'd say it went like
a) 10%
b) 30%
c) 60%
