Starting out with WODs for the first time was definitely an interesting process. Thankfully I'm already used to recording my screen since I stream myself playing video games on Twitch. The actual work itself was not TOO hard but it can be if you don't read the instructions carefully! I'd highly suggest starting your recording and quickly jotting down notes on a piece of paper. Brainstorming how you will get the project / workout done is crucial for getting a quick time. This is because you have a more guided path towards what you're trying to do instead of getting everything jumbled in your head. Each WOD has so far taken me at least two attempts to get it right but that's okay! Repetition is key to getting things down in memory, especially for something like coding. Another thing that you could do if you fail to get a passing time on your first try is watching the screencast and taking notes. It's very important to look at the process in way things are being done as well as the order. Order is SUPER IMPORTANT in coding. It can quite literally make or break your code, since code is read line by line. I wouldn't recommend just watching the screencast and doing it after because then you don't really get to figure out what you don't understand.
