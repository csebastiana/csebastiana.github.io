Unfortunately I am currently very behind on my WODs. For the ones that I did though, I usually look through the reading first. After that, I'll start up my Streamlabs OBS program and start to record my screen. I'll then do my best to figure out an idea of what I should code first in my head. I like to break things down into sections first. I think what is important when it comes to coding is coming up with a method in which you will do it. I like trying to picture how things work and I feel like this helps when it comes to writing programs or pages. When you get an idea of how you want something to look or act, all you have to do is figure out what you need to do to get there. 

Compared to the other WODs, the last one I did actually took a lot more time. I had to watch the screencast at least twice to remember what I needed to do in order to not have a DNF time. 

I think something that I'd do differently is try to write up a plan on a piece of paper after reading what the requirements are for the WOD. I think by doing this I can lay down a stronger foundation instead of trying to fix things and decide on what to do while I'm working, which will help in decreasing the time it takes.
